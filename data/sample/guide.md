# Sample RAG Guide

This is a small document to validate ingestion. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with text generation to provide grounded answers with citations.

Key points:
- Ingestion splits documents into overlapping chunks
- Embeddings are generated with BGE-base (CPU)
- Chunks are stored in Qdrant with source metadata
