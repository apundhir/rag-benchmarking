# GitHub Repository Settings - Manual Configuration Required

This document outlines the manual configuration changes needed in the GitHub repository settings to complete the brand enhancement.

## 1. Topic Tags

Navigate to: **Repository Settings → About → Topics**

Add the following topic tags:

```
enterprise-ai
responsible-ai
ai-evaluation
ai-benchmarking
production-ai
rag-evaluation
llm-evaluation
rag
fastapi
qdrant
```

**Purpose**: These tags improve discoverability and position the repo as enterprise-focused.

## 2. Website URL

Navigate to: **Repository Settings → About → Website**

Set the website URL to:

```
https://aiexponent.com/rag-evaluation-guide
```

**Purpose**: Links directly to your AiExponent article on RAG evaluation, driving traffic to your thought leadership content.

## 3. Description (Verify)

Ensure the repository description is:

```

```

This should already be set correctly based on the enhancement spec.
